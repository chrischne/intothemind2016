In this video, I talk about p5.js. What is it? What can you do with it? Where did it come from? What is its relationship with Processing? p5.js is both a library for JavaScript and a beginner-friendly editor where you can build creative computational projects in the browser. It can be used for art, data visualization, and websites alongside other tools like HTML5, CSS and JavaScript. Here are some links to help you get more info about p5.js and Processing:
